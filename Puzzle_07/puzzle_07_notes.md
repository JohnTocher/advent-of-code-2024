## Part 1
[my solution](puzzle_07-part_1_jmt.py)

I was erroniously counting the number of valid tests, not the total for quite a while  
and wodering what was broken.  Algoritm was fine, I just didn't read the question properly!

Found 266 valid tests from 850 for a total of 2299996598890

## Part 2
[my solution](puzzle_07-part_2_jmt.py)

Found 421 valid tests from 850 for a total of 362646859298554

This one was OK, but slower than I think it should be.  I thought pre-calculating the  
permutations of operators and re-using them might help, but it didn't do a lot.   
Exiting early from the calulation if it was too large helped a little.
