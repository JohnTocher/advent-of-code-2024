# advent-of-code-2024

Repository for shared solutions of AoC 2024!

## Solutions in python with an educational focus

This is essentially a clone of my starting 2023 repo.  I doubt I'll be finishing the 2024 challenges in a timely manner, I created it simply so I could have a go at a couple of early solutions I was discussing with a colleague.

Note that the results in my notes are for my puzzle input, they won't match yours, but if you want to test your code against my data, I have included 
it in the repository.

If you like the idea though, I have a more fully fleshed out set of instructions in my 2023 repo:
